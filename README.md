# Undergraduate Thesis – EMG Signal Analysis and Classification of Forearm Muscles

This repository contains all files related to the Undergraduate Thesis (**Trabalho de Conclusão de Curso – TCC**) developed by **Vinícius Franklin**, as part of the Electrical Engineering – Electronic Systems undergraduate program.

The work focuses on the acquisition, processing, feature extraction, and classification of electromyographic (EMG) signals collected from different forearm muscles. Distinct movement patterns are analyzed, and both unsupervised and supervised machine learning techniques are applied to evaluate signal individuality and classification performance.

## 📂 Repository Organization

The repository is structured according to the organization of the thesis and the experimental configurations adopted during EMG signal acquisition.


## 🔧 KiCad – EMG Sensor Hardware Design

This repository includes the **dedicated PCB design** of the EMG sensor used in the experimental setup.  
The hardware was designed using **KiCad**, including schematic capture, PCB layout, and project configuration files.

### 📁 KiCad
The following KiCad files are versioned to ensure full reproducibility of the hardware design:

- `.kicad_pro` → KiCad project file  
- `.kicad_sch` → Schematic design  
- `.kicad_pcb` → PCB layout and routing  


### 🔹 Acquisition Configurations
Each configuration corresponds to a specific forearm muscle:

1.  **First Configuration** → Flexor Carpi Radialis
2.  **Second Configuration** → Flexor Pollicis Longus
3.  **Third Configuration** → Flexor Digitorum Superficialis
4.  **Fourth Configuration** → Extensor Digitorum

Each configuration folder contains the raw datasets, extracted features, and machine learning models related to the respective muscle.

### 📊 EMG Signal Datasets
Within each configuration folder, approximately five `.csv` files are provided, corresponding to the following movement patterns:

* Relaxed muscle
* Contracted muscle
* Contraction and relaxation movement (~10-second period)
* Contraction and relaxation movement (~5-second period)
* Contraction and relaxation of each individual finger (~5-second period), aiming to analyze signal interference and the individuality of muscle activation.

## 🧠 Feature Extraction and Model Structure

To ensure clarity and reproducibility, the internal structure of each configuration follows this pattern:

```text
Number Configuration/
│
├── Models/
│   ├── Unsupervised/
│   └── Supervised/
│
└── Features Dataset/
```

### 🔹 Models/Unsupervised
Contains Jupyter notebooks (`.ipynb`) for feature extraction and unsupervised classification. Execution generates a `.csv` file with extracted features and labels. Each notebook documents how optimal parameters were obtained.

### 🔹 Models/Supervised
Contains notebooks that merge the labeled feature datasets within the same configuration to train and evaluate the supervised classification models.

### 🔹 Features Dataset
Contains all feature datasets generated by the unsupervised models, properly formatted for direct use in supervised learning.

## ▶️ Code Execution Guidelines
The codes were developed primarily using **Google Colab**, but can be executed locally.

### 🔧 Path Configuration (Required)
> [!IMPORTANT]
> Every script and notebook contains a variable named `path = `. You must update this variable to match your local directory structure before execution. This is required for every file.

### 🔧 Google Colab–Specific Code
When running locally, remove or comment out the following line:

```python
drive.mount('/content/drive')
```

## 📦 Dependencies
Install the required Python libraries using:

```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
```  

## ℹ️ Final Remarks
Since all feature datasets are already generated, you may skip the unsupervised stage and directly execute the supervised models if desired.
