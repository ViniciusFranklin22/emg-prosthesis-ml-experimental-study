Undergraduate Thesis – EMG Signal Analysis and Classification of Forearm Muscles

This repository contains all files related to the Undergraduate Thesis (Trabalho de Conclusão de Curso – TCC) developed by Vinícius Franklin, as part of the Electrical Engineering – Electronic Systems undergraduate program.

The work focuses on the acquisition, processing, feature extraction, and classification of electromyographic (EMG) signals collected from different forearm muscles. Distinct movement patterns are analyzed, and both unsupervised and supervised machine learning techniques are applied to evaluate signal individuality and classification performance.

📄 Thesis Documents

These documents describe the experimental setup, signal acquisition methodology, preprocessing stages, feature extraction methods, and the development and evaluation of classification models.

📂 Repository Organization

The repository is structured according to the organization of the thesis and the experimental configurations adopted during EMG signal acquisition.

🔹 Acquisition Configurations

Each configuration corresponds to a specific forearm muscle:

First Configuration → Flexor Carpi Radialis

Second Configuration → Flexor Pollicis Longus

Third Configuration → Flexor Digitorum Superficialis

Fourth Configuration → Extensor Digitorum

Each configuration folder contains the raw datasets, extracted features, and machine learning models related to the respective muscle.

📊 EMG Signal Datasets

Within each configuration folder, approximately five .csv files are provided, corresponding to the following movement patterns described in the thesis:

Relaxed muscle

Contracted muscle

Contraction and relaxation movement with an approximate 10-second period

Contraction and relaxation movement with an approximate 5-second period

Contraction and relaxation of each individual finger, with an approximate 5-second period, aiming to analyze signal interference and the individuality of muscle activation

Each dataset is clearly identified in the file name, indicating the associated movement pattern.

🧠 Feature Extraction and Model Structure

To ensure clarity and reproducibility, the internal structure of each configuration follows the pattern:

Number Configuration/
│
├── Models/
│ ├── Unsupervised/
│ └── Supervised/
│
└── Features Dataset/

🔹 Models/Unsupervised

This directory contains Jupyter notebooks (.ipynb) responsible for feature extraction from raw EMG signals and unsupervised classification of the datasets. Each notebook is associated with a specific movement pattern.

The execution of these notebooks generates a .csv file containing the extracted feature set and the classification label obtained through unsupervised learning. Each notebook also documents how the optimal parameter configuration was obtained for the corresponding dataset.

🔹 Models/Supervised

This directory contains notebooks and scripts that load the previously generated and labeled feature datasets, merge all feature datasets within the same configuration, and train and evaluate the supervised classification model associated with that configuration.

🔹 Features Dataset

This directory contains all feature datasets generated by the unsupervised models. These datasets are already properly formatted and can be directly used in the supervised learning stage.

▶️ Code Execution Guidelines

The codes in this repository were developed primarily using Google Colab, but they can be executed locally with minimal modifications.

🔧 Path Configuration (Required for All Files)

⚠️ Important:
Every Python script and Jupyter notebook in this repository contains a dedicated code block defining a variable named:

path =

This variable specifies the directory where the datasets and generated files are located.
Before executing any script or notebook, the user must update the path variable to match the local directory structure. This modification is required in every file, as each processing stage may use a different data path.

🔧 Google Colab–Specific Code (Local Execution)

When running the code locally, the following Google Colab–specific line must be removed or commented out:

drive.mount('/content/drive')

This line is required only when executing the notebooks in the Google Colab environment.

📦 Dependencies

All required Python libraries are listed in the file:

requirements.txt

Install the dependencies before execution using:

pip install -r requirements.txt

ℹ️ Final Remarks

Since all feature datasets are already generated and properly organized, users interested only in the final classification stage may directly execute the supervised models, without rerunning the unsupervised feature extraction process.
